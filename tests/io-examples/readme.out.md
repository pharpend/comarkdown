**Comarkdown**

Comarkdown is a preprocessor for plain-text documents of any format,
although it was originally intended for [Pandoc's
Markdown](http://www.pandoc.org/README.html#pandocs-markdown). At the
moment, it's very simple, and not even functional.

**Installation**

I recommend you use [Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/)
to install this. I haven't published a version on Hackage yet, so you'll
also need
[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to
download the source code.

foo bar

\moreshit
    git clone git://github.com/pharpend/comarkdown.git cd comarkdown
stack build

There isn't an executable yet, but you can run the test suite with
`stack test`.
