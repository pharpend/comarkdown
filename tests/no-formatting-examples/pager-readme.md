pager
=====

This is a Haskell library to open up the user's `$PAGER` with some
text. On Linux, the pager is usually called `less`. On the various
*BSD's, the pager is called `more`.

The pager doesn't notify people or anything - it takes long output and
presents it in pages.

This library is licensed under the FreeBSD license (the 2-clause BSD
license). Read the LICENSE file for details.
