# desbot

This is an IRC bot for the [`#snowdrift` channel on FreeNode][1].

For detailed usage information, please see the [manual][11].

## Coding guidelines

I roughly follow [Chris Done's style guide][8] for Haskell code.

I strongly suggest you use [Stack][9] for development. You can use the
old cabal sandbox way, but Stack is much nicer. desbot only compiles
with GHC 7.10, so you have to use Stack (or maybe [Halcyon][10]) if you
have an older version.

To use stack:

    git clone git://github.com/pharpend/desbot.git
    cd desbot
    stack setup
    stack build
    stack exec -- desbot --help

### Commit messages

You should try to follow the [Erlang OTP git commit guide][12]. I follow
most of those guidelines, with the exception of "don't end the title
with a period". It's a force of habit.

It's a good reference if you don't really know how to write good commit
messages.
