# Comarkdown

This is a Haskell library for writing fancy documents. It is
specifically tailored to work with [Pandoc], but it's not strictly
limited to that.

On the backend, comarkdown is simply a preprocessor. [Pandoc] can
convert almost any markup format to any other markup format. Comarkdown
just adds some help along the way.
